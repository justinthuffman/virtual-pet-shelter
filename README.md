#Virtual Pet shelter.

##Homeless virtual pets need a place to stay too.

9.21.18 10:21 - Initial class creation and commit to github.

9.22.18 18:49 - Ported previous virtual pet to virtual pet shelter. I think I'm going to have to start over beause it seems like too much work to port old pet into new project and I'd be better served by recreating this from scratch.

9.23.18 01:36 - Scrapped project. Started over. Final commit.
